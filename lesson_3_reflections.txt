When would you want to create a remote repository instead of creating from local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We might not always want to update all the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks allows you to copy someone elses repository and create your copy. However instead of a copy, it also keeps track of the origin of fork and all the commits that happened of the origin. Clone helps to copy a repository from Github into local or from one repository on localt to another repository on local.
Branch allows you to create two paths in the repository in which you can make changes in parallel.
